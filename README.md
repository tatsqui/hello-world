# hello-world
the first steps


+My name is Tatiana and I am an aspiring coder. I hope to matriculate into a coding academy like Ada or Deep Dive coding academy this upcoming fall. Some cool facts about myself are that I enjoy front-end development, and I also really like learning languages. I hope to get a good basic grasp of Ruby and Javascript in the next 6 weeks and my goal is to start a project and have something interesting to show my skill development. I am pursuing an opportunity to help my friend update their website, and this will be one of my first projects to showcase my skills development. I love learning and I feel that this foray into programming will be very exciting and fruitful for my future career!

 +On a more personal level, I love spending time in the natural world. I love hiking, car camping, traveling, recently my fix has been visiting the deserts of Utah and Arizona (really the whole southwest from Colorado to California and everything in between). Some sports I enjoy are Ice climbing and bouldering, and caneoing (any water sport). All outdoor activities are a healthy way to engage the world. I enjoy sharing my passion for the outdoors with other people who appreciate it (and with those who haven't had that privilege), and this passion of mine is very fulfulling. I hope that in six  months from now I will be studying like mad in a coding program and by summer of 2019, gainfully employed at an awesome tech company!!
