# hello-world
the first steps

My name is Tatiana and I am an aspiring coder. I hope to matriculate into ADA coding academy this upcoming August. Some things about myself are that I enjoy front-end development, and I also really like learning languages. I hope to get a good basic grasp of Ruby and Javascript in the next 6 weeks and my goal is to start a project and have something interesting to show my skill development. I love learning and I feel that this foray into technological language will be very exciting and fruitful for me! I also enjoy spending time in the natural world very much. I love hiking, car camping, traveling the deserts of Utah and Arizona (really the whole southwest from Colorado to California and everything in between. Ice climbing and bouldering are fun side pursuits that I dabble in from time to time. I enjoy sharing the natural world with other people who appreciate it (and with those who haven't had that privilege), and it is very fulfulling to me.
